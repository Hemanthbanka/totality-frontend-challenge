Overview

The Property Rental Platform is a full-stack web application built using React and Next.js. It provides users with a seamless experience for browsing and booking rental properties. The platform includes key features such as property listings with filters, a booking management system with a cart, and a checkout process. This project is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Approach

Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main sections:

Pages: These represent the primary views of the application, such as the home page, booking management, and checkout pages.
Components: Reusable UI components, such as PropertyCard, FilterBar, Cart, and CheckoutForm, are modularized to promote reusability and maintainability.
Styles: Global CSS and styled-components are used to define consistent styling across the application.

Key Features

Property Listings: Users can browse a variety of rental properties. Each listing includes an image, title, description, and price. Users can also apply filters based on location, price range, and number of bedrooms.

Booking Management: The booking management system allows users to add properties to a cart, adjust quantities, and view the total cost in real-time.

Checkout Process: The checkout page provides users with a form to enter their booking details, including contact information and payment details. The total cost is calculated and displayed before submission.

Responsive Design: The platform is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
